# Connect Apps

Connect Claude to 1000+ apps. Actually send emails, create issues, post messages - not just generate text about it.

## Quick Start

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./connect-apps-plugin
```

### Step 2: Run Setup

```
/connect-apps:setup
```

This will:
- Ask for your free API key (get one at [platform.composio.dev](https://platform.composio.dev/?utm_source=Github&utm_content=AwesomeSkills))
- Configure Claude's connection to 1000+ apps
- Take about 60 seconds

### Step 3: Restart Claude

After setup, exit and run `claude` again.

### Step 4: Try It

```
Send me a test email at YOUR_EMAIL@example.com
```

If it works, you're connected.

## What You Can Do

| Ask Claude to... | What happens |
|------------------|--------------|
| "Send email to sarah@acme.com about the launch" | Actually sends the email |
| "Create GitHub issue: fix login bug" | Creates the issue |
| "Post to Slack #general: deploy complete" | Posts the message |
| "Add meeting notes to Notion" | Adds to Notion |

## Supported Apps

**Email:** Gmail, Outlook, SendGrid
**Chat:** Slack, Discord, Teams, Telegram
**Dev:** GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear
**Docs:** Notion, Google Docs, Confluence
**Data:** Sheets, Airtable, PostgreSQL
**And 1000+ more...**

## How It Works

1. You ask Claude to do something
2. Composio routes the request to the right tool
3. First time? You'll authorize via OAuth (one-time)
4. Action executes and returns result

## Troubleshooting

- **"Setup command not found"** -> Make sure you started Claude with `claude --plugin-dir ./connect-apps-plugin`
- **"Need to authorize"** -> Click the OAuth link Claude provides, then say "done"
- **Action failed** -> Check you have permissions in the target app
